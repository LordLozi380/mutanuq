# Contribute

Anyone can contribute to this repository. You can contribute by creating new content, fixing typos or errors in the meaning of the content.

## Creating new content

To create new pages, go to the [docs folder](https://github.com/trueberryless-org/mutanuq/tree/main/starlight/src/content/docs). It is recommended to start creating new content in German, as this is the default language of [Mutanuq](https://github.com/trueberryless-org/mutanuq). Find a suitable folder inside the `de/` directory and follow these steps

1. Click `Add File` -> `Create New File` in the top right corner of the GitHub page.
2. The filename must end in `.md` or `.mdx` to work properly. If you are not sure which extension to choose, `.md` is recommended.
3. Add and edit this content as the first content in the new file:
   
    ```Markdown
    ---
    title: Title of the new page
    ---

    Short introduction to this topic.

    ## First heading
    ```
    
5. When you have finished creating the content of the new page, click `Commit changes...` at the top right of the page, choose a commit message and confirm your action again.
6. Press the `Create Pull Request` button and there you go.

Once a maintainer has reviewed your changes, you will be one of the contributors on the [Main Page](https://mutanuq.trueberryless.org/#our-contributors).

## Fixing errors

If you are browsing the site and see an error, we would be very grateful if you could fix it. The process of fixing it is very simple, as you don't need to download the entire GitHub repository.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click `✏️ Edit Page`.
2. Login to GitHub if necessary.
3. Click the ✏️ icon at the top right of the file view.
4. Click `Fork this repository`. This will create a copy of the repository `trueberryless-org/mutanuq` and save it under your account (`{username}/mutanuq`).
5. You should now see the edit view of the file, where you can fix the error you spotted earlier.
6. Click `Commit changes...` at the top right of the page, choose a commit message and confirm your action again.
7. Now all you need to do is spam the `Create pull request` button a few times, and that's it...

Soon after you submit your pull request, a maintainer will review it and merge it if everything is OK.
