title: Report
---

A report sums up the main information from a presentation, a survey, a meeting or perhaps some kind of incident such as an accident. It is usually written for somebody in authority (your boss, the head of a school, ...).

## Characteristics

-   formal
-   no `I` and no `you` (Do not address the reader!)
-   no short forms (e.g. "I'm", "You'll", "He'd", ...)
-   no colloquial expressions (e.g. "Catch you later", "Hang in there", "Bite the bullet", ...)
-   use passive constructions (e.g. ~"I can say"~ "It can be said")
-   all paragraphs have subheadings

## Layout

The report is divided into sections, each with a clear subheading that explains what the paragraph is about, with the first section being the introduction.

### General information

First write the name of the sender, the name of the recipient and the date of sending in the top left-hand corner.

> To: Stevie Wonder  
> From: Simon O'Neill  
> Date: 15 November, 2023

Then give the report a meaningful subject that briefly and succinctly summarises the topic of the report.

> Subject: Working abroad

### Introduction

After the basic information, a short introduction is written, in which the metadata of the survey, presentation or accident are mentioned. This includes, for example, the source of the survey, when and with which participants it was carried out, and also the location of the survey if it was only carried out in one country. It is also important to mention the reason for writing the report in the first place.

> The purpose of this report is to provide an overall picture of working abroad. It is based among a survey among around 3000 students at the ages of 18 to 29 years from Germany and was conducted in 2020.

### Findings

The next step is to incorporate the most important numerical data from the study into a continuous text. Always start with the extreme values, as these are particularly interesting.

### Possible subheadings

Depending on the content required by the bullet points, there are now a maximum of two further paragraphs with subheadings. For example, it is often necessary to make a recommendation to facilitate the implementation of the solution to the problems identified. Sometimes, however, it is simply necessary to give further reasons as to why these problems arose in the first place. The report therefore **ends** with either a **recommendation or** a **conclusion**.

#### Recommendations

Identify ways in which the current situation could be improved and suggest next steps for making such a change.
