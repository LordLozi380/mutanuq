There are many different types of emails. You can distinguish them roughly into two types: **formal** and **informal**, with many more subtypes of formal emails, such as a job application email or a complaint email. Whether an email is formal or informal is always determined by the situation and people you write to.

## Informal email

A informal email is mostly written to friends, colleagues or other people outside the work life.

### Characteristics

-   informal (personal)
-   use `I` and `you`
-   write about private matters (if you write to a friend)
-   use words from the language of the conversation (“Nice!”, “xD”, “OMG”, ...)
-   not necessarily about something factual or objective; more subjective topics

### Layout

#### Overall information

Always start with the metadata, like your own email, the recipient's email, the date and a subject line.

> From: trueberryless@email.com  
> To: tom.cruise@email.com  
> Date: 20th January, 2024

> Subject: What's up?

#### Salutation

Depending on the recipient, you must write a salutation in two different ways. If the recipient is known, you can address them directly, like so:

> Dear Mr Cruise!

If the recipient is unknown, you address them indirectly, like so:

> Dear Sir or Madam!

There are also two options if it comes to punctuation after the salutation:

-   Exclamation mark: `Dear Sir or Madam!`
-   Comma: `Dear Sir or Madam,`

:::caution[Caution]
No matter whether you end the salutation with exclamation mark or comma, the first letter of the introduction must always be **UPPERCASE**.

#### Introduction

Write a nice introduction where you explain why you are writing the email (kinda like a longer version of the subject line).

| Haven't heart from you for a while. What's up?                                     |
| I'm sorry to hear that something terrible happened. Can you tell me more about it? |

Depending on the topic or reason of the email, you should also add a personalized introduction.

#### Main part

Write the main part of the email. This can include a recent story of yours or maybe even some pictures from your recent holidays. Whatever you like, as long as it is appropriate for the topic.

#### Conclusion

Close your email with an appropriate conclusion. This means that you may sum up the main information once more or maybe ask a thought-provoking question.

> I hope that we will hear from each other again soon.

#### Close

The last element of the email is the closing.

> Best regards,  
> Felix

### Specific types

#### Email of application

##### Content

Say how you heard about the job in the introduction. In the main part you need to cover the following information:

-   Summarize your experience, skills and qualifications.
-   Show that you have the skills asked for in the job advertisement.
-   Say what **you can do for the company**, _not_ what they can do for you.
-   Outline what makes you different from other candidates.

Finish the body of your email by offering the reader more information and ask for an interview.

:::tip[Tip]
The main reason for writing an email of application is the **ask for an interview**. So just ask in the conclusion.
