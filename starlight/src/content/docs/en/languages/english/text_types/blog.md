A blog is a regularly updated website typically run by an individual or a small group. The latest entry, called a **blog post**, is usually displayed at the top of the main page. A blog is a dynamic and interactive medium; it can be updated and it allows the visitor to communicate with the author by leaving a **blog comment** attached to each individual post.

The goal of many bloggers is to provide their readers with information, to open discussions or share opinions, emotions and experiences. Man institutions and businesses also use blogs to promote their activities and products.

## Blog post

### Characteristics

-   formal or **informal** (depending on the readership and purpose)
-   use the first-person `I` and `you`
-   use direct questions to engage the readers and invite them to leave a comment
-   devide the post in paragraphs (without headlines)

### Layout

#### Overall information

A blog post starts with the name of the authro and date of publication. Do not forget to add the current time in the same line as the date because some commenters share their opinion immediately and you want to be able to recreate the order of publications.

#### Headline

A blog post requires a **captivating title** because for most readers the decision as to whether to read the rest of your post rests upon these few first words.

> Paper books - a thing of the past?

#### Introduction

Fill the introduction with the main topic of the blog post and information which are necessary to know in order to understand the topic properly.

> It's really amazing how many people have started reading e-books recently. Even my dad - who doesn't think I need a smartphone - has decided to get one. Now he's considering getting rid of his book collection because it takes up too much space. In its place, my parents say they could put a modern wall-mounted television.
